                                    OVERVIEW
This project uses shell-scripting to build a secure vault system. It contains directory creation, file permissions and system monitoring
This project is divided into 4 scripts

                                    THE SCRIPTS INCLUDE:

vault_setup
   This creates the secure_vault directory and initializes the files in it

vault_permissions
   Displays and manages file permissions

vault_ops
   A menu used to add and update secrets and perform log actions

vault_monitor
   Monitors vault files and permissions, detects risks, and generates a report

                                     NOTE:
The keys file is never displayed for security reasons
The final report is saved in the vault_report file inside secure_vault
